# Stone cart

 **Note:** It doesn't provide any HTML structure for your shopping cart. People use different front-end frameworks, therefore, it doesn't make any sense to couple this element with any of them. Also, this element doesn't provide any mechanism to store items of a shopping cart. You have to implement it on your own.
